# module5challenge

This module challenge deals with data vizualtion and use of pandas as well as matplotlib. 

I have adapted some code from the following in-class activities: 
-- TV_ratings : Helped use as model for my for-loops in this activity
-- regression : Sampled code used to construct a linear regression model for section 'Correlation and Regression'
-- summary_stats : Sampled code used to find bounds and interquartile range for section 'Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots'

All other code original with some functions and their syntax being refreshed using chatgpt.

# Update 6/17: 
Code updated to fix some misunderstandings I had when I initially did the assignment. Appreciation for grader "D.A." for their suggestions on improving this code.
